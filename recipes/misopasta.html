        <h4>What you'll need:</h4>
        <ul>
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <li>2 Tbsp of red miso paste</li>
            <li>Penne (I know the picture has linguine in it but penne is better for this one)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <p>Seasoning:</p>
            <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp of pepper</li>

    </div>

        <h4>Intsructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill pot with enough water to cook the pasta for 10 minutes. Add salt into the water. Stir occasionally to make sure pasta cooks properly.</li>
            <li>Strain pasta. Pour the pasta water into a cup to use for later. We only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>Prep mushrooms and cut into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Mix miso paste and butter together. This doesn't need any salt as the miso paste has quite a bit of sodium in it.</li>
            <li>In a pan, heat up olive oil in medium heat then add mushrooms and cook for 1-2 minutes. Once those are done, remove mushrooms and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add heavy whipping cream and pepper. Reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Once the whipping cream starts to slowly boil, add the miso mixture and stir until its all mixed</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the ingredients into the pan and stir until the pasta is covered in sauce</li>
            <li>Enjoy your pasta with a fine red wine</li>
        </ol>
